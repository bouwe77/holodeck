# Remix-Slides

An app for presenting your slide decks, which you write in Markdown or MDX in your favorite IDE or editor. Built with Remix.

# Usage

Clone and start the app:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bouwe77/remix-slides
cd remix-slides
npm run dev
```

Create your first presentation:

- Open the `slides` folder.
- Create a sub folder with the name of your presentation.
- In that folder, create a .md or .mdx file, for example `slides.mdx`.
- Add some text to that file, for example `# Welcome` and save.
- Refresh the app in the browser, navigate to your presentation.
- Click the "Start Presentation" button.
- Add more slides in the same file by separating them with `---`.
- Or create another .md or .mdx file and add slides there.
- Refresh the browser evey time you change something to your slides.
